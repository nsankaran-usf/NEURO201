# NEURO201
Welcome to the Github repository for *NEUR 201: Data analysis and research methods for cellular Neuroscience*. This repository is where you will find all data-analysis activities that you will complete throughout this course. There are two separate folders: one called *In-class activies* contains code for various exercises we will complete together during lectures, and another called *Assignments* contains the code for data-analysis exercises you will complete on your own as graded assignments. 

You will access all code in a format called *Jupyter notebooks*, which is like an interactive textbook in which you can create, edit, and run chunks of code. You don't need to install anything to access these notebooks! Instead, we will run them on a remote server (called Google Colab). Access the notebooks on Colab using the button below:

[![Open All Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/nsankaran-usf/NEURO201)

Once you click on the button, the window shown below will open. Select the file you want to work on (e.g., a particular assignment or in-class coding activity). This will open the notebook. <br>

Next, select File &#8594; Save a Copy in Drive<br>

A new notebook should then open with the title "Copy of [file name]". This copy of the notebook now "lives" on your google drive, and you can now begin working on the assignment or activity by making edits to this copy of the notebook!<br>
